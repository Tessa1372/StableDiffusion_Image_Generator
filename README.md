This project provides a simple implementation of the Stable Diffusion model for generating images from text prompts. The Stable Diffusion model is a powerful deep learning model that can create detailed images based on descriptions provided by the user. This project allows you to generate high-quality images by simply specifying the desired scene or object in textual form.

To use this project, you need to set up the required dependencies, which include Python 3.7 or higher, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Diffusers library. Once the environment is ready, you can run the provided Python script that loads the model and generates images from user-defined prompts. The image is saved locally and can be displayed using an image viewer.

The project also supports both CPU and GPU execution. For GPU support, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with the appropriate drivers installed. If GPU resources are unavailable, the script will fall back to CPU for image generation. The process is straightforward and can be executed on local machines or cloud environments like Google Colab.

This repository also provides guidance for troubleshooting common issues, such as errors related to missing GPU drivers or unsuccessful image generation. If you're looking to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
